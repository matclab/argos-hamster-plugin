# Installation
`make` will copy the plugin in ~/.config/argos

If you have `inotifywait` installed, the script will force a refresh by 
changing the script creation time after an event is created with the *hamster* 
UI when launched from this argos script.


# Configuring
Check the beginning of the file and tweak to your taste
